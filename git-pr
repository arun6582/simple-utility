# its irritating and slow to create a pull request through UI
# works with macos x out of box just place it inside ~/bin/ and add ~/bin to your $PATH
# replace open with xdg-open if using on linux

# git pr target_user target_repo target_branch source_user source_branch[optional]
# git pr coverfox rblog pre-master arun6582 [yourbranch(option)]
# yourbranch is optional in case you want to create a pr with current active branch
# its a nobrainer and faster than ui in case u have these commands saved in bash history
